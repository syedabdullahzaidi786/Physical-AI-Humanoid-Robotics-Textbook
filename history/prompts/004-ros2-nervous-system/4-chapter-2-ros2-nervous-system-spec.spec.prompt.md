## Prompt

Chapter 2: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Target Audience:
- Students learning robotic control and ROS 2 fundamentals.

Focus:
- ROS 2 architecture: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions.
- Bridging Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy.
- URDF overview for humanoid robots.
- Creating ROS 2 packages, launch files, and parameter management.
- Hands-on exercises for middleware control.

Success Criteria:
