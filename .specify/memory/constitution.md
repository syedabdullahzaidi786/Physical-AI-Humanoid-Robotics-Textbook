# AI/Spec-Driven Book on “AI-Powered Software Development & Engineering Practices” using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code, deployed on GitHub Pages. Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Assisted Accuracy
Validate all technical concepts using credible and up-to-date sources.

### II. Developer-Focused Clarity
Target intermediate to advanced software engineers and AI practitioners.

### III. Spec-Driven Structure
Ensure chapters and examples follow structured specs for consistency.

### IV. Practical Relevance
Emphasize real-world use cases and production-ready best practices.

### V. Vendor-Neutral Objectivity
Avoid bias; fairly compare alternative tools.

## Standards

### Documentation Alignment
Statements MUST align with official documentation or authoritative sources.

### Code Quality
Executable or near-production-ready code; follow style guides; include explanatory comments.

### Citation Rules
APA 7; 40% official docs, 30% peer-reviewed articles, rest from reputable industry sources.

### Writing Standard
Professional, educational, developer-friendly tone; Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9–12.

### Spec-Kit Compliance
Chapters MUST follow Spec-Kit workflow (spec → draft → refine → review → publish).

## Structure

- Preface
- 10–12 Chapters
- Appendices (tools, references, commands)
- Glossary
- Index

## Constraints

### Word Count
Entire book 20,000–30,000 words; each chapter 2,000–3,000 words.

### Output Format
Docusaurus site deployed to GitHub Pages; supports search, dark/light mode, versioning, syntax highlighting.

### Plagiarism
0% tolerance; all content MUST be original.

## Successful Criteria

### Book Completeness
All chapters written, validated, and compiled in Docusaurus.

### Spec Compliance
Every chapter traces to its defined spec.

### Technical Accuracy
Claims verified against credible sources and official documentation.

### Readability & Quality
Meets readability standards; consistent formatting; tested or syntax-validated code.

### Deployment Success
Fully functional Docusaurus site with working navigation, search, mobile responsiveness, and no build errors.

### Final Review
Passes fact-check, technical review, and quality audit before publishing.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews MUST verify compliance. Complexity MUST be justified.
